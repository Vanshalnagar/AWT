# Pratical3 - React Login (Vite)

This folder contains a small React app (Vite) that shows a login screen. Logging in with username `admin` opens the admin welcome page; `student` opens the student welcome page.

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (16+ recommended)

Quick start:
```bash
cd Pratical3
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- This is a minimal dev setup. For production builds run `npm run build`.
